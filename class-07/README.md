## Constructor Functions

We'll look at how to build constructor functions from object literals and discuss the most basic fundamentals of prototypal inheritance, a huge JS topic that we'll be seeing a lot more of in the coming weeks.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 7 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate an object literal into a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to use the ‘prototype’ property to extend the inheritable properties and methods of a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to dynamically build an HTML table with JavaScript and render it to the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
